### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a portfolio website. I'd really like to show off a little bit about myself.
As someone with a creative background, I want my portfolio website to reflect that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript using freecodecamp.
I'm really hoping to get acquainted with React soon, but I want to make sure my basics are 100% solid!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on quite literally anything! I'm very open to working with other people.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also a comedian!
